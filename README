Currency converter in Java, we can develop a simple project using Spring Boot for the backend and Thymeleaf for the web interface. The system will allow the user to input an amount in one currency and convert it to another, using simulated exchange rates (or integrated with a real API, if desired).

Project Structure
Currency Converter (CurrencyConverter): Main class that performs the conversions.
Controller: To manage HTTP requests.
Thymeleaf Template: For the user interface.
Conversion Service: To manage the conversion logic.
Steps to Create the Project
Create the Project with Spring Boot:

Use Spring Initializr to generate the project with the dependencies:
Spring Web
Thymeleaf
Package Structure:

com.example.currencyconverter (main package)
controller (for the controller)
service (for the conversion service)
model (optional to model data, if necessary)

Code Explanation
CurrencyConverterService: Service that contains the currency conversion logic. It simulates exchange rates for several common currencies. The conversion is done using the reference currency (USD) to simplify calculations.

CurrencyConverterController: Controller that manages requests to the converter. Displays the conversion form and processes conversions sent by the user.

Thymeleaf Template (converter.html): User interface for the converter. Includes a form where the user can select the currencies and the amount to be converted.

Possible Expansions
Integration with External API: To get real and up-to-date exchange rates, you can integrate with an external API such as Exchange Rates API or Open Exchange Rates.

Data Persistence: Add persistence to save conversion history, preferred currencies, or user profiles.

Validation and Errors: Add additional validations for user input and handle errors in a friendly way.

Authentication: Add authentication to allow users to save currency preferences or conversion history.
